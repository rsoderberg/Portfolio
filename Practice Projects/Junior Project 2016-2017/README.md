###### The White Elephant Project connects users to their friends and family for a stress-free gift-giving experience. The White Elephant application lets users plan parties and anonymously check off which gifts they've purchased for others (without spoiling the surprise!) "Purchased" gifts are not revealed to the wish list's owner, nor is the purchaser revealed to other party members.
