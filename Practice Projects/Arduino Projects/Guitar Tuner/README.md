# Guitar Tuner
###### Final Project submission for Microcontrollers w/ .NET course - June 2017  
###### Take in frequencies using the onboard microphone and determine whether they match particular keys (EBGDAE) to tell the user (via LEDs and visually on the included .NET application) whether the note they played is sharp, flat, or on key.  
###### Optionally, the user may cycle through a tone of each note using the left and right buttons. Tones may also be played using the included .NET application.  
###### Red LEDs spanning to the left mean the played note is flat, red LEDs spanning to the right mean the played note is sharp, and two centered green LEDs means the note is on key.
