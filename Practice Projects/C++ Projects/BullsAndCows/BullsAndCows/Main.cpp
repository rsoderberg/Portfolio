// Description: Play "Bulls and Cows," the computer will generate four different integers in
// the range of 0 to 9 (e.g., 1234 but not 1122) and it is the player's task to correctly
// determine those numbers through repeated guesses. If the numbers to guess
// are 1234 and the user guesses 1359; the response will be "1 bull and 1 cow" because
// the user got one digit correct in the correct position (a bull), and one digit correct
// but in the wrong position (a cow). The guessing continues until the user gets four bulls,
// that is, has the four digits correct and in the correct order.
