# String Comparison
###### Write a program, without using any included libraries, that compares two strings.
---
#### Method:
	- Pass chars to function and compare the lengths. If not equal, the strings do not match.  
	- Until a null value is reached, read in the char arrays using a pointer and add them two new arrays (one for each string).  
	- If the two strings match, continue until null and output that there is a match, else break out and state that there is not a match.  

##### Libraries:  
iostream - handle test output only
