###### Problem:  
Create a struct named Student representing the student's details and store the data of the student.  
  
###### Input/Output:  
Input consists of four lines:  
	The first line contains an integer representing age.  
	The second line contains a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters ('a'-'z') representing the first name of a student.  
	The third line contains a string consisting of lowercase Latin characters ('a'-'z') representing the last name of a student.  
	The fourth line contains an integer representing the standard of the student.  
Output is a single line consisting of age, first name, last name, and standard. Each is separated by one space. Assume I/O will be automatically handled.  
  
Sample Input:  
	15  
	john  
	carmack  
	10  
Sample Output:  
	15 john carmack 10  
  
###### Method:  
	- Create Student struct and take in the lines of data.  
	- Output the data in a single line from the struct.
