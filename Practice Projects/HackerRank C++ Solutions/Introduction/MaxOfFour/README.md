###### Problem:  
Write a function which reads four arguments and returns the greatest of them. 
  
###### Input/Output:  
Input will contain four integers - a, b, c, d; one in each line.  
Print the greatest of four integers. Assume I/O is automatically handled.  
  
Sample Input:  
	3  
	4  
	6  
	5  
Sample Output:  
	6   
  
###### Method:  
	- Take in the four values.  
	- Compare values to determine which is the greatest number of the group, returning it when found.
