https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/birthday-cake-candles/problem  
    
###### Problem:  
Colleen is having a birthday! She will have a cake with one candle for each year of her age. When she blows out the candles, sheâ€™ll only be able to blow out the tallest ones.  
Find and print the number of candles she can successfully blow out.   
  
###### Constraints:  
	1 <= n <= 10^5  
	1 <= heighti <= 10^7  
 
###### Input/Output:  
The first line contains a single integer, n, denoting the number of candles on the cake.  
The second line contains n space-separated integers, where each integer i describes the height of candle i.  
  
Sample Input:  
	4  
	3 2 1 3  
Sample Output:  
	2  
  
##### Explanation:  
The maximum candle height is 3 and there are two candles of that height.  
  
###### Method:  
	- Take in n and ignore.  
	- Until n is reached, take in candle heights and compare each to the current stored tallest value.
		For the first value consider it the tallest and begin the counter at 1, resetting if a higher value is found.  
	- Output number of blowable candles.
