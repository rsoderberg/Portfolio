###### Problem:  
Create two classes:  
Rectangle - The Rectangle class should have two data fields, width and height of int types. The class should have a display() method to print the width and height of the rectangle, separated by a space.  
RectangleArea - The RectangleArea class is derived from the Rectangle class. The class should have a read_input() method to read the values of width and height. The class should also use the display() method to print the area (width x height) of the rectangle.  
  
###### Input/Output:  
The first and only line of input contains two space-separated integers denoting the width and height of the rectangle.  
The output should consist of two lines: The first line prints the space-separated width and height of the rectangle. The second line prints the area of the rectangle.  

###### Constraints:  
	1 <= width, height <= 100  
	
###### Sample Input:  
	10 5  
	
###### Sample Output:  
	10 5  
	50  
	
###### Explanation:  
Width = 10 and height = 5, so the area (width * height) = 50.
