Run the "DDOAliasSwitcher" Application file to use this program.

To add or modify your current raid aliases, right-click on "DDOAliasSwitcher.dll.config" and click Edit (Edit with Notepad++ is ideal, but regular Notepad is fine!)
Within each section labeled with the day of the week (e.g. <Tuesday>) you are able to add, remove, and relocate aliases as desired to meet new raid schedule needs and update text dialogs.


To add or modify your default locations and raid day settings, right-click on "DDOAliasSwitcher.dll.config" and click Edit (Edit with Notepad++ is ideal, but regular Notepad is fine!)
Within the <UserSettings> section, update FileLocation values with the full location address of your .layout file. The DefaultRaidDay must be a value listed in the dropdown on the app (such as "Tuesday").
