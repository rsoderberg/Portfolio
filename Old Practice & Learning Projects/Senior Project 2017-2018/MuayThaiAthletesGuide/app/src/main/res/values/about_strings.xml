    <string name="about">We founded our gym upon a philosophy based on promoting
        both the performance and longevity of our athletes. We know that, all too often, we are
        encouraged to choose results over the well-being of our bodies. Jiu jitsu, boxing, kickboxing,
        wrestling, and strength/conditioning are all high-impact sports. Because of this, it is vital
        to have a coach that is knowledgeable about recovery and the importance of avoiding
        over-training.  We are proud to offer some of the best martial arts instruction in the
        Pacific Northwest.</string>
