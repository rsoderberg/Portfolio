// Description: 
// Quadratic equations are of the form:
//          a * x^2 + b * x + c = 0
// To solve these, one uses the quadratic formula:
//          x = (-b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
// This program will calculate the roots for a quadratic equation, given a, b, and c.
// Roots are exactly the x-intercepts of the quadratic function f(x) = a * x^2 + b * x + c = 0,
// that is the intersection between the graph of the quadratic function with the x-axis.
