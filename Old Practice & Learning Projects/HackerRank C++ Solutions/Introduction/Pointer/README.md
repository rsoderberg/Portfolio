###### Problem:  
Complete the function which reads two integers as an argument. This function sets a with the sum of them and b with the absolute difference of them.  
  
###### Input/Output:  
Input will contain two integers, a and b, separated by a newline.  
Print the updated value of a and b, on two different lines. Assume I/O will automatically be handled.  
  
Sample Input:  
	4  
	5  
Sample Output:  
	9   
	1  
  
###### Explanation:  
a' = 4 + 5 = 9  
b' = |4 - 5| = 1  
  
###### Method:  
	- Take in the values for a and b.  
	- Update the values to find the sum for a and absolute difference for b.
