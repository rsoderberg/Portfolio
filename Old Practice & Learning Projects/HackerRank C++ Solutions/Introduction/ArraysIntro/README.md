###### Problem:  
Print the array of N integers in reverse order in a single line, followed by a space.  
  
###### Input/Output:  
The first line of input contains N, where N is the number of integers. The next line contains N integers separated by a space.  
Print the N integers of the array in the reverse order in a single line separated by a space.  
  
###### Constraints:  
1 <= N <= 1000  
1 <= Ai <= 10000, where Ai is the ith integers in the array.  
  
Sample Input:  
	4  
	1 4 3 2  
Sample Output:  
	2 3 4 1  
  
###### Method:  
	- Take values in, assigning N and adding the next line to the array.  
	- Count backwards, traversing the array and printing each value.
