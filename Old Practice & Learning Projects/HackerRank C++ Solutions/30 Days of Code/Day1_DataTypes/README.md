# Day 1: Data Types  
https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/30-data-types/problem  
      
###### Problem:  
Declare three variables: One of type int, one of type double, and one of type String.  
Read three lines of input from stdin and initialize your three variables.  
Use the + operator to perform the following functions:  
	1. Print the sum of i plus your int variable on a new line.  
	2. Print the sum of d plus your double variable to a scale of one decimal places on a new line.  
	3. Concatenate s with the string you read as input and print the result on a new line.  
 
###### Input/Output:  
The first line contains an integer that must be summed with i.  
The second line contains a double that must be summed with d.  
The third line contains a string that must be concatenated with s.  
Print the sum of both integers on the first line, the sum of both doubles on the second line, and then the two concatenated strings on the third line.  
  
Sample Input:  
	12  
	4.0  
	is the best place to learn and practice coding!  
Sample Output:  
	16  
	8.0  
	HackerRank is the best place to learn and practice coding!  
  
###### Explanation:  
When we sum integers 4 and 12, we get 16.  
When we sum the floating-point numbers 4.0 and 4.0, we get 8.0.  
When we concatenate the two strings, we get HackerRank is the best place to learn and practice coding!  
  
###### Method:  
	- Declare variables.  
	- Read inputs and store.  
	- Print sum of integer variables.  
	- Print sum of double variables.  
	- Print concatenated strings.
